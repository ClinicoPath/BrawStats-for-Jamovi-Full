Larger sample sizes cost more time, effort and often money. It is therefore worth asking whether two smaller studies are more productive than one large one.
The question is important not least because increasing sample size offers diminishing returns.
The benefit of going from 20 to 40 data points is much, much greater than the benefit of going from 120 to 140.
In this investigation, we look at this.
<br>
<br>
<b>In the first part of this investigation</b> you have a budget of 320 participants and you are operating in the model Psychology world.
<ul style=margin:0px;>
<li> Use all 320 participants in a single study.
<li> Now split them into 4 studies.
<li> Then 16 studies.
<li> And then 64 studies.
</ul>
In each case, note how many significant result and how many false discoveries you make.
Which combination gave you the most significant results? This is what will probably matter to you as a researcher.
Which combination gave you the most false discoveries? This is what will matter most to the discipline.
<br>
<br>
<b>For the second part, we are going to do a bit of cheating.</b> Each time we run a study, we start with a pre-planned sample size. If the result is not significant, then we add a few participants.
We continue until either our budget is used up, or we have a significant result.
<br>
How does this affect the outcomes? Can you see any temptation here?

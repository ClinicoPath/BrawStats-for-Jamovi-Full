<b>Inferences?</b> inferences using statistical testing are, of course, subject to errors.
<ul style=margin:0px;>
<li> False hits
<li> False misses
</ul>
How much do these matter?
<br>
<br>
<b>Strategies?</b> a researcher has to make an important choice about sample size because larger sample sizes are more costly. 
<ul style=margin:0px;>
<li> Should I use the biggest I can afford?
<li> Or should I use the smallest I can get away with?
</ul>
<br>
<b>Believable Results?</b> what do we do when there are 2 (or more) different results to compare or contrast?
<ul style=margin:0px;>
<li> Replication asks whether the result can be found again and is therefore competitive.
<li> Meta-analysis asks what inference might cover both results and is therefore collaborative.
</ul>
Which is better?
<br>
<br>
<b>Real Differences</b> sometimes 2 different results can happen quite properly?
<ul style=margin:0px;>
<li> In this case, replication is highly problematical.
<li> Meta-analysis for random effects, however, is good.
</ul>

When a study fails to replicate, this is usually understood to be an indication that the original finding was a false discovery.
And, <it>sometimes</it> it is thought that the original study was in some way faulty.
<br><br>
In this investigation, we set up a situation where two different groups of researchers get completely conflicting results.
However, there is a good reason for this. 
<br><br>
In short, the two researchers are, without noticing it, studying different populations as might happen if they worked in different countries.
This can be shown by including a third variable in the hypothesis, where the different countries favour different values for that variable.
<br><br>
It is hoped that these investigations have given you some insight into how statistical analysis works when it is scaled up across a whole discipline.

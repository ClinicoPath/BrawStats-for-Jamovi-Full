<b>In the first part of this investigation</b> we use a simple test situation.
<ul style=margin:0px;>
<li> The population effect size is either r<sub>p</sub>=0.0 or r<sub>p</sub>=0.3 with equal probability.
<li> The sample size is 50.
</ul>
Can you guess which population your result came from?
Did you get a statistically significant result?
<br>
Try this a few times and see (i) how easy it is to guess the population and 
(ii) how safe the p-value is as a guide to which population.
<br>
<br>
<b>In the second part of this investigation</b> we use a world that models Psychology.
<ul style=margin:0px;>
<li> The population effect size is either zero (50%) or drawn from an exponential distribution (50%).
<li> The sample size is 50.
</ul>
What happens now? How likely is a significant result? And if you get a significant result, how likely is it false discovery?

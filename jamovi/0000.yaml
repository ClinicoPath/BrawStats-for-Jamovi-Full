  BrawStats is designed to teach the basic principles of statistics.

  It operates by simulation of the quantitative research process:
    i.   hypothesis
    ii.  design
    iii. data collection & analysis
  It has a graded set of demonstrations that take the user through basic
  processes.

  It also has a simulation control interface that allows the user to explore
  many different aspects of data and statistical analysis.

  BrawStats functions:
    i.   data simulation
    ii.  general linear models
    iii. path models
